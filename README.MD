#Mixed Messages

##What is this?

This is my take on the Mixed Messages portfolio project in CodeCademy's Full-Stack Developer course. The task for the assignment is to generate a random message every time the program is run, pulling from at least three different peices of data. In the case of my version, data is pulled from a random index of three different arrays and then concatenated together in the `console.log()`

##What do you mean, portfolio project?

Truthfully, I couldn't tell you. Supposedly, this is supposed to be something that I can showcase on my portfolio, but the project seems far too simple to me for it to be a good showcase. The extreme simplicity of this "portfolio" project, is leading me to question whether or not I completely missed some requirement in the assignment. I will be seeking clarification on the matter, and will gladly come back and rewrite things if it turns out that I did miss a large piece of the project.
